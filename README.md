This is the code of a sequential algorithm for assortative edge switch in a labeled network.

The program takes 5 parameters as input:

  1) Input graph (in adjacency list format)
  2) A demographic file containing the labels of the vertices
  3) The name of the output graph
  4) Shuffle ratio in [0,1]: what percentage of the edges needs to be switched, e.g., 0.5, and 1 mean 50% and 100% edges will be switched, respectively
  5) A flag (0/1) denoting whether to write the output file: 0 means do not write, 1 means write the output graaph
